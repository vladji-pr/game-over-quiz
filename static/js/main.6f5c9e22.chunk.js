The game follows the adventure of a claymation character named Klaymen as he discovers his origins and his purpose in a world made entirely out of clay. When the game was originally released, it was unique in that all of its animation was done entirely in claymation, including all of the sets, rather than 2- or 3-dimensional computer graphics, like many other games at its time. The gameplay consists mostly of the player guiding the main character Klaymen around and solving puzzles to advance in the game. As the player advances through different areas of the game, there are various video sequences that help advance the plot. In addition to being unique, The Neverhood aimed at being quirky and humorous, as is evident by the characters, the music, and the plot sequence of the game.",image:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XnDZgNcJtCE/maxresdefault.jpg",audio:"http://23.237.126.42/ost/neverhood/zkfesdbt/14%20Dum%20Da%20Dum%20Doi%20Doi.mp3"}]],g=t(1);t(25);var f=function(e){var
